# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository will serve as a catalog for the data Structures and algorithms 
that I practice for coding. I didn't major in Computer Science and have heard from
multiple sources that this tends to be a weakness for people coming from a non-compsci
background. I've automated creating a prompt, main, and test file
for each problem in bash (script can be found in my myScripts repository in the 
dsTemplates file). Each problem will include a prompt, sample input and output, 
and as many potential solutions as I can think of as well as the time complexity 
analysis.
