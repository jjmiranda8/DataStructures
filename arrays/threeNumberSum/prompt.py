Given an array and a targetSum, create a function that returns an array of all 
possible combinations of three numbers within the given array that sum up to the 
targetSum.

Sorting the array and using pointers is nice way to solve this. 
Using a hash table might be tricky because the possibily of doubles

SAMPLE INPUT:
1) [12, 3, 1, 2, -6, 5,-8, 6], 0
2) [12, 3, 4, 1, 6 9], 24

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1) [[-8, 2, 6], [-8, 3, 5], [-6, 1, 5]]
2) [12, 3, 9]
